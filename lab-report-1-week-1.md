# 1. Installing VScode
[VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)   
Follow the link above to install VScode. 

![Test Image 1](images/vscode_download.png)
<br>After clicking the link, it should bring you to a page similar to this which you will then click on "Download Mac Universal" or the dropdown next to it for other options.

<br>![Test Image 2](images/vscode_zip.png)
<br>After the file has download, click on the zip file for it to fully install.

<br>Once VScode has finish installing, you should open the application and it should look like this.

# 2. Remotely Connecting
<br>Remote connecting is a way to access remote server through the internet to access other OS, files, or programs that are not accessible from your personal computer.
<br>I have a MacBook but if you have a Windows computer you will need to install [OpenSSH client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui)

<br>To begin you need to open the terminal in VScode(Ctrl or Command + \`, or use the Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option)
In the terminal you will type in - `ssh (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

<br>![ssh1](images/ssh_step1.png)

<br>After entering the `ssh` in the terminal you will be prompted to enter a *password* (which will not show a response)

# 3. Trying Some Commands
<br>There are many useful commands we can run in the terminal. Some very useful ones are:
- ssh (server): securely connects to a remote server
- scp (file) (path): securely copies a file to a remote computer
- cd (path): changes the directory
- ls: lists files from the current directory
- cat (file): prints the contents of a file
- cp (file) (path): copies a file(not secure)

# 4. Moving Files with scp
<br>Other than accessing remote servers with `ssh`, you can also copy files from your device to the remote device. This can be accomplished through `scp` or "secure copy protocol"
<br>In the terminal you will type in - `scp (filename) (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
<br>After entering the *scp* in the terminal you will be prompted to enter a *password* just like `ssh` and after the information has been submitted you will need to enter the remote server again through `ssh` to access the file you just copied

<br>![scp](images/scp.png)

<br>As seen from the example above I ran `javac` and `java` for "WhereAmI.java" showing my directory information. Then after the "WhereAmI.java" has been copied to the remote server, I logged in again through `ssh` and ran `javac` and `java` for "WhereAmI.java" showing different results suggesting the terminal runs commands based on where the command is ran resulting in different outputs from remote and local computers. 

# 5. Setting an SSH Key
<br>As you seen before, it consumes time to use *ssh* and *scp* because the need to type in a password. However, that can be avoid by setting up an SSH Key for your computer so you won't need to type in a password everytime you access the remote server.
<br>To start you will enter `ssh-keygen` into the terminal, which you will be prompted by some text but you just need to press *enter* all the way through

<br>![key](images/ssh_keychart.png)

<br>The result will look something like this and you will know it is completely after the image chart is produced.
<br>If you are on windows please you can follow [these](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation) steps.

<br>The next step is to log into the remote server with `ssh`
<br>After you are on the server, enter `mkdir .ssh` in the terminal then log out by typing `exit` in the terminal

<br>![key2](images/ssh_key.png)

<br>You will then need to `scp` the "public key" given to you after you entered `ssh-keygen` (remember the public key, not the private)

<br>`scp (public key) (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

<br>After that is completed, the next time you *ssh* or `scp` into this remote server, there wouldn't be a prompted password

# 6. Optimizing Remote Running
<br>Something to consider while coding is optimization, and this can be succeeded through the reduction of keystrokes. For example:
- Using `;` will run multiple commands on the same line in the terminal instead of having you type commands out seperate times like `javac` and `java` or `ssh` and `scp`
- Using `""` will allow you to run commands inside the `""` right after `ssh` such as running `javac` and `java`

<br>`scp WhereAmI.java (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/; ssh (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu "javac WhereAmI.java; java WhereAmI"`

<br>![opti](images/opti.png)
<br>This example shows the use of `;` and `""` where right after the use of `scp`, `ssh` is also ran with `javac` and `java` inside the quotes.
